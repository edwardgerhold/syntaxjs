syntaxjs
========

Not bugfree EcmaScript 6 Interpreter written in EcmaScript 5

It can be tried with simply typing node syntax0.js. The line to
start syntaxjs.nodeShell() is at the end of the file. It can also
be required.

There is an object "syntaxjs" in the global Space. Also in the
browser. The browser version is currently broken, coz i did not
care for the last time.

I wrote a lot of comments about the bugs and the architecure and
all the design mistakes here, but i should reflect again and write
something understandable up.

'''bash
linux-www5:~ # node syntax0.js
'''

So there are some commands which worked earlier and are broken today.
I see it in my few tests. I broke the code last month, but i am optimistic.

I waited and waited for releasing something less buggy and now i do exactly
the opposite, i upload a version when itÂ´s brokener than ever.
