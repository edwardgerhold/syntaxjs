syntaxjs
========

Not bugfree EcmaScript 6 Interpreter written in EcmaScript 5

It can be tried with simply typing node syntax0.js. 

linux-www5:~ # node syntax0.js [exec_me.js]

```javascript
es6> let f = x => x*x;
undefined
es6> f(100);
10000
es6>
undefined
es6> let s = Symbol.for("Test");
undefined
es6> let obj = { [s]() { return Symbol.keyFor(s); } };
undefined
es6> Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(obj, s).value.name;
[Test]
es6> obj[s]()
Test
es6>
undefined
es6>
```
Sometimes i break code here, sometimes there. 

The other day, i fix it :-)

Current status is "broken". A couple of mistakes is uncleared since december.
But not the problem. 

- Currently underspecified, but the documents may arrive fast the next days.
- Have to write up the documentation, and to split the file up into modules, 
that you can have and edit pieces of.
- Have filled out a few issues for myself.
- Have an english book at hand, next time i will write better.
- Then i will have to tell you again.

Hope to annoy you not too much with the bugs!


# currently strict mode fails

Which is not a problem. it just fails in the current version. iÂ´ll remove this note,
when i fixed it. I need to, because i want the test262 cases to pass in strict mode again.

On my homepage the older version proves, that strict mode was already implemented correctly.
The current version is broken and i just have to search for, last time i discovered it, i 
checked the parser first with the .print command but strict mode is parsed correctly. It must
be somewhere while evaluating. At instantiate global or function or when evaluating the call,
nothing special, but is a to do.

https://github.com/tc39/test262 is the official testsuite for ecmascript. If you remove
in the last block of the file the command syntaxjs.nodeShell() which starts the shell, 
test262 is running without break

Says i got to fix strict mode. My tester.js Tests are giving a little more information,
but for now i am early at the beginning to work with the official tests.

Test262 can be run with a single command

```bash
TEST262DIR=/www/test262
${TEST262DIR}/tools/packaging/test262.py --command="node /www/syntax0.js" --tests=${TEST262DIR}
```
