In other words, you may do anything with, which is anyways allowed. I grant
you a possibility change away from my license and align it with your needs.
You may hack it, delete it, remove it, replace it, re-release it, maybe you
forget my name, maybe you would like to rename it. You can do what you want
with, you are allowed to. That´s for my part of the program.

The list of copyrights and people i have to respect for this pile of bugs is
long.

Special thanks to Allen Wirfs-Brock, the editor of the EcmaScript 6 specification
for very good code and plain text. It´s dense, it´s concise and very different from
what i wrote before. I hopefully have learned something for life from this document,
how to write better code, and how requirements and co have to be written. I hope that
i taught myself with how to concretly handle errors correct through the whole program,
through a whole real application.

My code lacks a bit (lot) in performance and has some beginner´s mistakes, but concretly
i see more of them, than one may expect. Mostly i have to fight against my laziness.
I am not in a hurry, so days pass me by before i do. Like half of the time.

This program contains code from the EcmaScript Edition 6 document. And it already
contains code from the actual ES7 proposals from http://github.com/tc39/ecma262
from WebDirections, Dslomov, @mathias, erights.
There is a edit of a module by @mathias with a large unicode table for String.isIdentifierStart()
and String.isIdentifierPart().
I wanted to implement the Concrete Syntax Tree by @getify et al. but didn´t manage it yet
to do so. Currently there is no code but will be.
There is a parser by Douglas Crockford in lib/parsenodes/crockfords-parser.js written down from
his homepage from his tutorial.
Formerly i cited @domenics DWTFYWTDW License to express what i mean. And i´ve forgotten to remove
the Aplus Test Adapter, for the obligatory "good that it´s not happening in production" gag.
There is one file from V8 in test/listings/symbols-only.js
I have already made use of emscripten/docs/paper.pdf and asmjs.org/spec/ and have the aims to
finish these documents some day. Together with the compiler implementation, which will probably
no "asm.js" but make use of the HEAP technology. On the other side i have decided to develop a
typechecker for the toolbox, there will be use for.
The Parser_API AST belongs to Mozilla. And for historical reasons, i have seen esprimas parser and
website already in 2012, which influenced the kind of parser, while it´s development was 101% independent.
One forgotten? Will write up.
Yes. Thanks to Jetbrains for my current IDE, a WebStorm 8 Evaluation Version, making it possible to overwork
the whole thing again and again with all comforts and extras.
Thanks to anyone else who contributed to the used documents and codes, to es-discuss for entertainment
and education, to github for my free repository.
For our pet Gizmo. Rest in Peace. I continued this syntax highlighter when you wasn´t there anymore.
My girlfriend hates my computer.
