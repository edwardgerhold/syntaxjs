Placeholder for the License Terms for syntaxjs

syntax0.js (c) or (w) Edward Gerhold 2013, 2014

I still have to figure out, which license is the right one.


I think i will find the answer in the Open Source Definition.
opensource.org/docs/osd
but i won´t finish this update of the license today
i will write down what´s standing there then
making sure to hit the osd then

Here are my first notes of what the license will outline:

* EcmaScript 6 Specification belongs to Ecma, TC-39, and it´s editor,
which is most of the code. (And the more sophisticated, something to learn from.)
* Mozilla Parser API belongs to Mozilla, which is the Syntaxtree Format.
* There is a module with a functional parser by Douglas Crockford, from a
tutorial on his website, written down by hand. It´s currently not in use, 
but inclusive (it will be split into an own file, yes, but i think, it will
also get it´s time being in use for something in the future).
* Esprimas Demo on it´s Website esprima.org inspired me to add a button, 
to show the ast of a highlighted text, and to use JSON.stringify(code, null, 4);
As i remember again. I have seen the array of tokens there. Already in 2012.
When i first wrote a syntaxhighlighter, which later in 2013 became this tool.
* I wrote code with promisesaplus.com and github.com/domenic/promises-unwrapping
and people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/js-loaders but these parts are superseeded by 
the latest specification
* The /unicode directory contains a code by mathias bynens modified to test in 
constant time for code point values in a set but adds a size of 1meg for the 6.3
table (reduced the original in this file)
* Object.observe is included, but not finished, only the half is written,
the internal methods are not updated with yet.
* An Emitter is inspired by Node.js but a complete own Implementation.
* I already started to add Structured Cloning for Cross Realm
* Which will incorporate EventTarget, Event, and MessagePort from the DOM.
The names are already registered in the global environment. (Whether i come
to implement the Node Interface when doing the propagation is open.)
* I have started to include dslmomovs Type Objects specification from github
* Then i have a special project viewed on the internet, over es-discuss and
got interested in. The Concrete Syntax Tree by getify et al. This tool contains
little portions of some upcoming Source Code preserving Tree, which will be
suitable for code editors.
* Everything else is written and even invented by me. You can see it at the
mistakes. That´s mine..

I think i can grant you the rights to use, modify and distribute the software
and make your own with
and the same conditions, the others licenses grant me. I won´t change my mind,
that´s for sure. But to be correct, i still have to figure out, what we got.u

I should take the "Do what the fuck you wanna do with license", i have seen
together with the releases of the promises-aplus-tests, by Domenic Denicola. I think
it´s his public domain license. The license expresses what i mean.

Oh. 
All persons namely called are not affiliated with me in any way. I just took
from the internet, what was there. I meant not to disturb or stress anyone with,
please. I simply want the tool to be open, free, and be there for anyone.

Have fun!
(Or be annoyed at the moment because of the open bugs, hehe. 
I´ll mark it big and fat if it´s no longer the case.)
