Placeholder for the License Terms for syntaxjs

syntax0.js (c) Edward Gerhold 2013, 2014

I still have to figure out, which license is the right one.

* EcmaScript 6 Spezification belongs to ECMA, which is most of the code.
* Mozilla Parser API belongs to Mozilla, which is the Syntaxtree Format.
* There is a module with a functional parser by Douglas Crockford, from a
tutorial on his website, written down by hand. It´s currently not in use, 
but inclusive.
* Esprimas Demo on it´s Website esprima.org inspired me to add a button, 
to show the ast of a highlighted text, and to use JSON.stringify(code, null, 4);
As i remember again. I have seen the array of tokens there. Already in 2012.
When i first wrote a syntaxhighlighter, which later in 2013 became this tool.
* I wrote code with promisesaplus.com and github.com/domenic/promises-unwrapping
and people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/js-loaders but these parts are superseeded by 
the latest specification
* Object.observe is included, but not finished, only the half is written,
the internal methods are not updated with yet.
* An Emitter is inspired by Node.js but a complete own Implementation.
* Everything else is written and even invented by me. 

I think i can grant you the rights to use, modify and distribute the software
and the same conditions, the others licenses grant me. I won´t change my mind,
that´s for sure. But to be correct, i still have to figure out, what we got.u

Have fun!
