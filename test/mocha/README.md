Mocha Tests
===========

This will be the first time, i use mocha.

Providing only my own test interface makes the system more reliable, if 
they are valid, and the system passes the tests.

But using a popular library offers more possibilities.

I think it´s good if i use all the tools around. It´s what they educate today.
And it´s what the others are programming for. But to use them, i have to learn
them. That may take time or not happen, or ... whatever. Let´s do it.

Here i will put some tests for mocha into.

And for testmaker.js which i will use for more simple and quickly written test,
i could write, as i proposed myself a testwriter, the .json down with some mocha
commands and perform the tests with mocha.
