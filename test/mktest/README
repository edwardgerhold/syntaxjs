# HOWTO test syntax.js
# mktest <number>
# another idea for creating handwritten tests
# (all useless, but if you do have a testsuite :)


1. create a new test with 
-------------------------
mktest <number>

if test<number>.js isnt existing test0.js and code0.js are copied.
This saves time creating the boilerplate over and over again.

2. then edit:
------------
code<number>.js - the code to initialize the interpreter with
test<number>.js - the tests running on the results of the code

3. run with 
-----------
node test<number>.js

The code<number>.js will be loaded and the test functions will be run 
against whatÂ´s in the memory after executing the code.
